# Uber-like Ride-Sharing Application

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack ride-sharing application inspired by Uber, featuring real-time location tracking, ride management, and separate interfaces for riders and drivers (captains). The application enables users to book rides, track drivers in real-time, and complete the ride with ratings and reviews.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** - For building the user interface with component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** - For responsive and modern UI design
- **Socket.io Client** - For real-time communication between users and captains
- **Axios** - For HTTP requests to the backend API
- **React Router** - For client-side routing
- **Mapbox GL** - For interactive maps and real-time location tracking

### Backend
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side code
- **Express.js** - Web framework for building the API
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for storing user, captain, and ride data
- **Mongoose** - ODM for MongoDB
- **Socket.io** - For real-time bidirectional communication
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** - For secure authentication
- **Express Validator** - For input validation

### APIs
- **Mapbox API** - For maps, geocoding, and directions
- **Geoapify API** - For location services and address autocomplete
- **SerpAPI** - For search functionality

## Features

### User Features
- **Authentication** - Secure signup and login system
- **Ride Booking** - Search for locations and book rides
- **Fare Estimation** - Get fare estimates before confirming rides
- **Real-time Tracking** - Track captain's location in real-time
- **Ride History** - View past rides and details
- **Rating System** - Rate captains after completing rides
- **Payment Management** - View fare details and payment status

### Captain Features
- **Authentication** - Dedicated signup and login for captains
- **Ride Acceptance** - View and accept pending ride requests
- **Navigation** - Get directions to pickup and destination locations
- **Arrival Updates** - Send estimated arrival times to users
- **Ride Management** - Start, complete, and track rides
- **Earnings Dashboard** - View ride history and earnings
- **Profile Management** - Update vehicle details and personal information

### Common Features
- **Real-time Notifications** - Get alerts for ride status changes
- **Socket-based Communication** - Instant updates without page refreshes
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Mapbox API key
- Geoapify API key
- SerpAPI key

## Key Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
- JWT-based authentication for both users and captains
- Secure token storage and verification
- Protected routes for authenticated users

### Real-time Communication
- Socket.io for bidirectional communication
- Room-based communication for ride-specific events
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

### Location Tracking
- Geolocation API for user/captain location tracking
- Mapbox for rendering maps and driving directions
- Real-time location updates via sockets

### Ride Lifecycle
1. User requests a ride with pickup and destination
2. Nearby captains receive ride requests
3. Captain accepts the ride and navigates to pickup location
4. Captain starts the ride after picking up the user
5. Captain completes the ride at the destination
6. User rates the ride experience

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using:
- Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting service
- Backend: Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, or any Node.js hosting service
- Database: MongoDB Atlas or any MongoDB hosting service

## Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Payment Methods** - Add support for credit cards, digital wallets
- **Ride Scheduling** - Allow users to schedule rides in advance
- **Multiple Vehicle Types** - Support for different vehicle categories
- **In-app Chat** - Direct messaging between users and captains
- **Promotional Offers** - Discounts and promotional features
- **Multi-language Support** - Localization for different regions
- **Advanced Analytics** - Dashboard with ride statistics and insights
